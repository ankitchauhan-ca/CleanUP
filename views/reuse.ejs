            <h1>The Reuse Principle of the 3 Rs</h1>
            <p>The main goal of the "Reuse" principle is to find new uses for items you might otherwise throw away. This
                helps to reduce the demand for new, resource-intensive products and decrease the amount of waste sent to
                landfills. Here are some ways you can reuse items:</p>

            <h2>Use Reusable Bags and Containers</h2>
            <!-- Ensure the image path is correct -->
            <img src="/images/reuse-bag.jpg" alt="Reusable bags and containers" class="responsive-image">
            <p>Instead of using single-use plastic bags, opt for reusable bags made from durable materials like cotton,
                jute, or recycled plastic. You can also use reusable containers for take-out, leftovers, or storing
                food.</p>

            <h2>Repurpose Household Items</h2>
            <img src="/images/repurpose.jpg" alt="Repurposed household items" class="responsive-image">
            <p>Think creatively about how you can reuse items you already have at home. For example, you can use old
                jars for storing spices, coffee cans as planters, or old t-shirts as cleaning rags.</p>

            <h2>Donate or Sell Gently Used Items</h2>
            <img src="/images/donate.jpg" alt="Donate or sell items" class="responsive-image">
            <p>Give new life to items you no longer need or use by donating them to charity or selling them through
                online marketplaces. This helps to extend the life of the item and reduce waste.</p>

            <!-- Add more sections and images as needed -->

            <p>By adopting these reuse strategies, you can significantly reduce the amount of waste you generate and
                contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
