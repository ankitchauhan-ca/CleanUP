        <p>The main goal of the "Reduce" principle is to minimize the amount of waste we generate in the first place.</p>

            <h2>Ways to Reduce Waste:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose products with minimal packaging:</strong> Opt for products that have less packaging
                    or packaging made from recycled materials to reduce landfill waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Buy in bulk:</strong> Purchasing items in bulk can help reduce packaging waste by replacing
                    multiple small packages with one large container.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid single-use items:</strong> Single-use items like plastic bags, straws, and cutlery
                    contribute significantly to waste production. Using reusable alternatives can help reduce the number
                    of these items that end up in landfills and oceans.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider the product's lifecycle:</strong> Think about the entire lifecycle of a product
                    before purchasing. Choosing durable, long-lasting products can help reduce the frequency of
                    replacement and, consequently, waste generation.</li>
                <li><strong>Use digital alternatives:</strong> Replace paper documents, CDs, and DVDs with digital
                    versions when possible to reduce the demand for physical products and their waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Borrow or rent items:</strong> Instead of buying items that you'll only use once or a few
                    times, consider borrowing or renting them to reduce the demand for new products and their waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Repair and maintain items:</strong> Regularly maintaining and repairing items can help
                    extend their lifespan, reducing the need for replacements and the waste generated from discarded
                    items.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <p>By incorporating these practices into your daily life, you can significantly reduce the amount of waste you
            produce and contribute to a healthier environment.</p>
